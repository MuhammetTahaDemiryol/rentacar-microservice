# Rent-A-Car project

### In this project I am going to translate my monolith rent-a-car project into microservices architecture.

### Which will include the following structures:

- [x] **Common-Package**
- [x] **Inventory Service**
- [x] **Filter Service**
- [x] **Payment Service**
- [x] **Invoice Service**
- [x] **Rental Service**
- [x] **Maintenance Service**

---

- [x] **Identity Server**

---

- [x] **API Gateway**

---

- [x] **Eureka Discovery Service**

---

- [x] **Config Server**

---

- [x] **Message Broker**
